    - useContext
    - custom hook
- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project gained knowledge about the useReducer and Context API in React. I have also learned how to manage local data using the useEffect hook and local storage. I discovered that the reducer hook is highly effective when dealing with actions and dispatching objects. I delved into the reasons and methods for using custom hooks in the Context API. I also learned how to utilize the context provider with children and values. Additionally, I found that Tailwind CSS significantly reduces development time, especially when implementing a theme switch.

### Useful resources
